<h1>Why do I need a google account?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  This course's programming exercises require access to google colab.
</h5>

<p>
  In this course, we will be using
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">google colab</a>
  to run our programming exercises. Google colab is a great platform that allows
  us to share Python code and access high-performance hardware resources through
  a web browser. It is free to use but requires a google account to access.
</p>

<p>
  In order to access the programming exercises and design, train and evaluate
  your AIs, you will need a valid google account.

<h1>How do I get a google account for this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  There are three possible ways to get your google account set up for this course.
  <ul>
    <li>use your existing personal account</li>
    <li>create a new google account</li>
    <li>use your UF credentials to access you UF-associated account</li>
  </ul>
</h5>

<h4>Using an existing account</h4>
<p>
  If you have a @gmail.com email address, then you already have a google
  account, and you are free to use your existing account for this course.
</p>

<h4>Creating a new account</h4>
<p>
  If you don't have an existing google account and would like to create a
  new personal account to use for this course, go to
  <a href="https://accounts.google.com" target="_blank">
    https://accounts.google.com</a>
  and follow the instructions to create a new account. If google automatically
  logs you into an account, then you probably already have an account, and
  you are free to use that one.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you use an existing account or create a new one, this will be your
  personal google account that you can take with you after you leave UF; you
  are personally responsible for your account.
</p>

<h4>Using your UF-associated google account</h4>
<p>
  If you have a University of Florida email address and a gatorlink id, you
  should have a google account already set up and associated with your UF
  credentials; you may use your UF-associated google account for this course.
</p>

<p>
  To log into your UF-associated google account, go to
  <a href="https://accounts.google.com" target="_blank">
    https://accounts.google.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you are already logged into a google account and would like to switch
  to your UF-associated account, click on your account icon in the upper-right
  corner and either select your UF-associated account from the drop-down
  list, or click on "Add another account". You will then need to click on
  "Use another account" and enter your UF email address in the sign-in form.
  Click the "Next" button, which will take you to the UF login page. Enter
  your gatorlink id and password, navigate through the two-factor
  authentication protocol, and you should be logged into your UF-associated
  google account.
</p>
<p>
  If you are not already logged into a google account, you should see a list
  of possible accounts. Select your UF-associated account, or click on
  "Use another account", enter your UF email address, and click the "Next"
  button. This will take you to the UF login page, where you can enter your
  gtorlink id and password, navigate two-factor authentication, and then
  you'll be logged into your UF-associated account.
</p>

<p>
  For convenience, I made a short video demonstrating how to create your own
  personal google account or log into your UF-associated account using your
  gatorlink credentials. However, the instructions on the google accounts
  page should be the most reliable and up-to-date information about creating
  and accessing your google accounts.
